# data-engineering-zoomcamp-sprint
This repository contains my work for the Data Engineering Zoomcamp course. Since I am doing a sprint, I will be completing the course in a condensed timeframe, so the units I complete each week will not match the original course structure.

**NOTE:** I will also be diving deeper into certain aspects that seem to need more attention and improvement for real-world applications. For example, the ingestion of the csv taxi data into a Postgres database will be done 3 different ways: using the python script provided in the course, using alternative libraries (like dlt), and using the `\copy` command in Postgres.

## Week 1
### Unit 1: Docker and Terraform
- Deployed a Github Codespace

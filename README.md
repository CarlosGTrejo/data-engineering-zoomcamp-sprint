# data-engineering-zoomcamp-sprint
This repository contains my work for the Data Engineering Zoomcamp course. Since I am doing a sprint, I will be completing the course in a condensed timeframe, so the units I complete each week will not match the original course structure.

## Week 1
### Unit 1: Docker and Terraform
- Deployed a Github Codespace and installed Terraform.
